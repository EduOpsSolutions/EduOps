- Old and new values

### Email Notifications

- Sent to OLD email for security
- Includes contact information for reporting
- Non-blocking (won't prevent updates)
- Errors logged for troubleshooting

### Password Handling

- Passwords are hashed before storage
- Password changes logged as "Password: Updated" (no values shown)
- Passwords not included in change comparison logs

## API Endpoints

### Update User

**Endpoint:** `PUT /users/:id`

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "firstName": "string",
  "middleName": "string | null",
  "lastName": "string",
  "email": "string",
  "phoneNumber": "string | null",
  "birthyear": "number | null",
  "birthmonth": "number | null",
  "birthdate": "number | null",
  "role": "admin | teacher | student",
  "status": "active | inactive | suspended | deleted",
  "profilePicLink": "string | null",
  "password": "string (optional)"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "error": false,
  "message": "User updated successfully"
}
```

## Email Template

The email notification uses a professional HTML template with:

- Red header with EduOps branding
- Alert boxes for important information
- Clear old → new email display
- Security warning section
- Contact information
- Responsive design

## Future Enhancements (Suggestions)

1. **Password Change Notifications**: Send email when admin changes a user's password
2. **Email Verification**: Require verification when email is changed
3. **Change History**: Display full change history in the UI
4. **Bulk User Updates**: Allow bulk role changes or status updates
5. **Advanced Filters**: Filter users by multiple criteria simultaneously
6. **Export Audit Logs**: Export security logs to CSV or PDF

## Troubleshooting

### Birthdate Not Displaying (FIXED)

**Symptoms:** Birthdate field shows "mm/dd/yyyy" placeholder instead of actual date when editing users

**Root Cause:**

1. Backend `getAllUsers` endpoint was not returning birthdate fields (`birthyear`, `birthmonth`, `birthdate`) in the select clause
2. Frontend was using `&&` operator which fails when any value is `0`, `null`, or falsy
3. Inconsistent use of `||` vs `??` operators for null checking

**Solution Applied:**

1. ✅ Added `phoneNumber`, `birthyear`, `birthmonth`, `birthdate` to backend `getAllUsers` select clause
2. ✅ Changed frontend date display condition from `&&` to `!= null` check
3. ✅ Used nullish coalescing operator (`??`) consistently throughout all birthdate handling
4. ✅ Added date clearing handler for when users want to remove birthdate

**Files Fixed:**

- `api/controller/user_controller.js` - Lines 48-65
- `client/src/components/modals/manage-accounts/UserAccountDetailsModal.js` - Lines 30-32, 124-126, 159-161, 376-406

### Email Not Sending

**Symptoms:** Email change notification not received

**Possible Causes:**

1. SMTP credentials not configured
2. Email service blocked/rate limited
3. Old email address invalid
4. Network connectivity issues

**Solutions:**

1. Check `api/utils/mailer.js` configuration
2. Verify SMTP credentials in environment variables
3. Check console logs for error messages
4. Test email service with a simple email

### Fields Not Saving

**Symptoms:** Changes not persisting

**Possible Causes:**

1. Field not included in payload
2. Validation error on backend
3. Database constraint violation

**Solutions:**

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check network tab for API response
3. Verify field is in `userAccountStore.js` payload
4. Check backend logs for validation errors
